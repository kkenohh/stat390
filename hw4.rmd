# Question 1
a). Geometric Distribution. It has one parameter, *p*, which is the probability of winning at least one of the lotteries. The value we pass in as *p* would be P("win one") = 1 - P("win neither") = (1 - (1 - *p1*)(1 - *p2*))

b). The expected number of times you would need to play for a win would be 1/(1 - (1 - *p1*)(1 - *p2*)).

# Question 5
a).
```{r}
pnorm(65, mean = 50, sd = 10) - pnorm(45, mean = 50, sd = 10)
```

b).
```{r}
top3 <- qnorm(.97, mean = 0, sd = 1)
top3 * 10 + 50
```

c).
```{r}

```

# Question 6
```{r}
pApple <- rev(apple[,7])
rApple <- diff(log(pApple))*100
pjnj <- rev(jnj[,7])
rjnj <- diff(log(pjnj))*100
```
